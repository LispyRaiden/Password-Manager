# Password-Manager
An application that manages your passwords.

The application will open up a small window which asks you to create a master password which will be used to access the vault.
You will have to re-enter the password to make sure you remember it. 
When created it will create a password vault database file as a seperate file in the path you have the application at.

Dont delete this, it will delete all the passwords, you should only delete it if you forget the master password, but it also reset everything.
The create password will only pop up on the first time start up.

Inside the password vault you can click on the '+' button to add a password.
You can add a website, username, and a password, I will add example for example purposes.

The passwords should still be there when you restart the application. 
They will no longer be there along with the master password if you delete the password db file.

Thank You!!
